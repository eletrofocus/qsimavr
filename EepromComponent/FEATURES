1 Kbit/128 bytes storage
Controlled over I2C as a slave
Timing checks (especially 5ms write cycle)
Only last 8 bytes of a write data transfer stored

Address:

ST  A7  A6  A5  A4  A3  A2  A1  R/W
    1   0   1   0   *   *   *   1/0

Byte Write:
After control byte, the next byte is the word address which is written into the
address pointer. The next byte is written to address. 

Page Write:
Similar to byte write. Written only once STOP is received. On each byte, lower
4 bits of address pointer are incremented. Higher order 7 (??) bits remain
constant. If more than 8 are received, address counter will _roll over_. Writes
are always to a single page!!

No ACK returned if device busy during write cycle!

Current Address Read:
After control byte, data at address counter is sent (which is not acknowledged). STOP

Random Read:
Write address, START, read.
