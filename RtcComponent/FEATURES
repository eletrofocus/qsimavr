Adjustments for months with < 31 days, leap years until 2100
56 bytes of NV SRAM
24h or 12h/AM/PM mode

RTC registers in addresses 0x00 - 0x07
RAM registers in addresses 0x08 - 0x3f (addresses wrap around to 0x00)

Day of week increments at midnight ( % 7) + 1 (?)

Reset date: (Clock Halt set to 1)
MM/DD/YY DOW HH:MM:SS
01/01/00  01 00:00:00

After writing seconds, remaining time + date registers must be written within 1
sec.

Control register:
Mainly controls output on square wave pin...

TWI address: 1101000
Write: Control Byte -> Word Address -> 0 or more data bytes.
Read:  Control Byte -> Data bytes until NAK (starting from current address pointer)
